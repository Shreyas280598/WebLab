			<h2> Player Unknown's Battleground </h2>

		<p>PUBG is an online multiplayer game played using LAN connected devices. There are over 100 members in the lobby or equal to 25 teams land together in a selected map.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="row">
		  <div class="column" style="background-color:#bba;">
		    <h2>Column 1</h2>
			<p>In this a room will be created so that the members who are interested can join into the lobby and play the game. The final team that survives till last takes the chicken dinner.  </p>
		  </div>
		  <div class="column" style="background-color:#aaa;">
		    <h2>Column 2</h2>
			<p>When the room is created the id and passoword will be shared by the moderator so that the team can input that and enter into the lobby and play the game. So the matches are scheduled as mentioned in the above block.</p>
			</div>
		  <div class="column" style="background-color:#abb;">
		    <h2>Column 3</h2>
			<p> So finally we can say that in no time this game has become a addiction in youngsters and they start gaming from morning till evening without a gap,which causes various health issues hence the game developer has introduced various measures to prevent this like restricting the game to played only for 8 hrs and the player should be above 18 years</p>
